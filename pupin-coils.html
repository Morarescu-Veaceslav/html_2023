            Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin
            coils", followed closely on the pioneering work of the English
            physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's
            patent by some seven years. The importance of the patent was made
            clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American
            Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy. Although AT&T
            bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already
            had their own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up
            to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent.
            AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was
            immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of
            long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.
